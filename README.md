RayCaster made for Bitbox ! 
============================

This is a port of the http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html examples to bitbox native examples.

Not a real game now, but might evolve to one someday. Works on the real Bitbox at 400x300 fullscreen.
Could use a bit of love / optimization :)

use gamepad  / keyboard arrows to navigate.
